# iOS PWA Prompt Element

## Demo

The demo page is built to work as an interactive documentation, change the parameters, reset localStorage and reload the page to see how it works.

[Demo Link](https://felquis.github.io/ios-pwa-prompt-element/)

## Usage

You can easily load the library from a CDN:

try [jsdelivr.com](https://jsdelivr.com/) CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ios-pwa-prompt-element@0.0.1/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

try [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ios-pwa-prompt-element@0.0.1/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

or npm directly

```bash
npm install ios-pwa-prompt-element
```

then import globally, the custom element will be automatically registered:

```
import 'ios-pwa-prompt-element'
```

It won't work on ssr context.

#### Vue usage

comming soon, will follow the same principle as react above.

## Project Goals

ðŸŽ¯ **Identify Gaps**: vanilla HTML custom element with zero dependencies.

ðŸ”§ **Implementation**: port to address the need for a lightweight solution.

âœ… **Thorough Testing**: extensive testing using Cypress to ensure reliability.

ðŸ“¦ **Publication**: easy to distribute via CDN scripts or npm package import

## Motivation

### Background

The development of the iOS PWA prompt can be traced through several significant contributions:

- **Initial Appearance**: The concept first surfaced on GitHub with [pwaPrompt](https://github.com/samvimes01/pwaPrompt?tab=readme-ov-file), which includes an article detailing the necessary checks to display a custom prompt that iOS does not provide. You can read more about it in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@oleksandr_k/a-way-to-show-a-prompt-to-install-your-angular-pwa-both-on-android-and-ios-devices-7a770f55c54).
- **Notable Implementations**:

  - The most popular implementation is the [react-ios-pwa-prompt](https://github.com/chrisdancee/react-ios-pwa-prompt), which inspired various forks and adaptations:
    - [react-ios-pwa-prompt-ts](https://github.com/thenick775/react-ios-pwa-prompt-ts): A TypeScript version with additional props and Storybook support.
    - [vue2-ios-pwa-prompt](https://github.com/acepoblete/vue2-ios-pwa-prompt): A Vue 2 adaptation.
    - [svelte-ios-pwa-prompt](https://github.com/edrichhans/svelte-ios-pwa-prompt): A port for Svelte.
    - [vue-ios-pwa-prompt](https://github.com/jayplin/vue-ios-pwa-prompt): A port for Vue 3.

- **Other Resources**:
  - Research related to the optimal timing for displaying prompts can be found in the [iOS-friendly service worker repository](https://github.com/webzep/ios-friendly-serviceworker/tree/master).
